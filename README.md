# Oliver_Simon_PortfolioProject

## Description

This project is a website framework for a portfolio of my future projects. It contains links to my github, linkedin, and contact information, as well as a look at some of my most recent projects. It will also contain an about me section with personal and career info.

For this project, I wanted to create a snapshot of my skills and work for potential employers or collaborators to look at.
